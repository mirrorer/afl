This directory contains replacement files that should enable experimental
ARMv7 instrumentation in place of the default x86 code. Several notes:

  - This code is behind the "mainstream" version and lacks some of the
    features and checks added recently.

  - The code is confirmed to work only in the sense that it allows libpng 
    and jpeg9c to be compiled with ./configure --disable-shared and run
    without catching fire. 

  - In fact, something is known to go wrong when --disable-shared is *NOT*
    specified. The most likely explanation is that there is a jump table /
    literal pool out there somewhere that we do not recognize and inject 
    instrumentation into, breaking alignment.

    Hard to troubleshoot because it only happens with big programs like
    libpng. If you find smaller programs that misbehave, please let me know!

  - To compile on ARM, you need to take several manual steps:

    1) Copy the *.c and *.h files in this directory to the root directory of 
       the project (../../), overwriting the original code,

    2) Edit the top-level Makefile to delete the first line that mentions
       '__asm__' (without quotes).

    3) Type in 'make clean all',

    4) Cross your fingers for good measure.
