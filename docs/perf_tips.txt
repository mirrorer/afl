This file provides some tips for troubleshooting slow or wasteful fuzzing
jobs.

1) Keep your test cases small
-----------------------------

This is probably the single most important step to take! Large test cases do
not merely take more time and memory to be parsed by the tested binary, but
they also make the fuzzing process dramatically less efficient in some other
ways.

To illustrate, let's say that you're randomly flipping bits in a file, one bit
at a time. If you flip bit #47, you will hit a security bug; flipping any
other bit just results in an invalid document.

If your starting test case is 100 bytes long, you will have a 71% chance of
triggering the bug within 1,000 execve() calls - not bad! But if the test case
is 1 kB long, the probability that we will ever randomly pick that bit goes
down to 11%. And if it has 10 kB of non-essential cruft, the odds plunge to 1%.

In practice, this means that you shouldn't fuzz image parsers with your
vacation photos. Generate a tiny 16x16 picture instead, and run it through
jpegtran or pngcrunch for good measure. The same goes for most other types
of documents.

There's plenty of small starting test cases in ../testcases/* - try them out
or submit new ones!

2) Use a simpler target
-----------------------

Consider using a simpler target binary in your fuzzing work. For example, for
image formats, bundled utilities such as djpeg, readpng, or gifhisto are
considerably (10-20x) faster than the convert tool from ImageMagick.

Remember that you can always use such simple tools to generate a corpus that
will be then fed to a more resource-hungry program later on.

3) Have a closer look at the binary
-----------------------------------

Check for any parameters or settings that obviously improve performance. For
example, the djpeg utility that comes with IJG jpeg and libjpeg-turbo can be
called with:

  -dct fast -nosmooth -onepass -dither none -scale 1/4

...and that will speed things up. There is a corresponding drop in the quality
of decoded images, but it's probably not something you care about.

You may also want to use strace -tt or an equivalent profiling tool to see if
the targeted binary is doing anything unnecessarily slow. Sometimes, you can
speed things up simply by specifying /dev/null as the config file, or disabling
some compile-time features that aren't really needed for the job (try
./configure --help). One of the notoriously resource-consuming things would be
calling other utilities via exec*(), popen(), system(), or equivalent calls.

Last but not least, if you are using ASAN and the performance is unacceptable,
consider turning it off for now, and manually examining the generated corpus
with an ASAN-enabled binary later on.

4) Avoid instrumenting ALL THE THINGS
-------------------------------------

Instrument just the libraries you actually want to stress-test right now, one
at a time. Trying to simultaneously instrument glibc, zlib, gmp, OpenSSL,
and libxml2 to test a single program is an overkill.

5) Parallelize your fuzzers
---------------------------

The fuzzer is designed to need ~1 core per job. This means that on an 8-core
system, you can easily run eight parallel fuzzing jobs with relatively little
performance hit. For tips on how to do that, see parallel_fuzzing.txt.

6) Keep memory use and timeouts in check
----------------------------------------

If you have increased the -m or -t limits more than truly necessary, consider
dialing them back down.

Keep in mind that some programs end up spending a lot of time allocating and
initializing megabytes of memory to accommodate pathological inputs. Low -m
values can make them give up sooner - long before hitting the "hard" time
limit defined with -t - without necessarily sacrificing coverage.

7) Check OS configuration
-------------------------

There are several OS-level factors that may affect fuzzing speed:

  - High system load. Use idle machines where possible.

  - Network filesystems, either used for fuzzer input / output, or accessed by
    the fuzzed binary to read configuration files (pay special attention to the
    home directory).

  - On-demand CPU scaling. The Linux 'ondemand' governor runs on a specific
    schedule and is known to underestimate the cost of short-lived processes
    spawned by afl-fuzz (or any other fuzzer). On Linux, this can be fixed with:

    cd /sys/devices/system/cpu
    echo performance | tee cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

    On other systems, the impact and potential solutions may be different.

  - Suboptimal scheduling strategies. On my Linux system, you can get few
    percent extra by doing:

    echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/sched_child_runs_first
    echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/sched_autogroup_enabled
    echo 50000000 >/proc/sys/kernel/sched_migration_cost_ns
    echo 250000000 >/proc/sys/kernel/sched_latency_ns

8) If all other options fail, use -d
------------------------------------

For programs that are genuinely slow, in cases where you really can't escape
using huge input files, or if you simply want to get quick and dirty results
early on, you can always resort to the -d mode.

The mode causes afl-fuzz to skip all the deterministic fuzzing steps, which
makes output a lot less neat and makes the testing a bit less in-depth, but
it will give you an experience more familiar from other fuzzing tools.
