Not sure if you should upgrade? The lowest currently recommended version
is 1.48b. If you're stuck on an earlier release, it's strongly advisable
to get on with the times.

--------------
Version 1.49b:
--------------

  - Added code save original command line in fuzzer_stats and
    crashes/README.txt. Also saves fuzzer version in fuzzer_Stats.
    Requested by Ben Nagy.

--------------
Version 1.48b:
--------------

  - Fixed a bug with QEMU fork server crashes when translation is attempted
    after a jump to an invalid pointer. Reported by Tyler Nighswander.

--------------
Version 1.47b:
--------------

  - Fixed a bug with afl-cmin in -Q mode complaining about binary being not
    instrumented. Thanks to Jonathan Neuschafer for the bug report.

  - Fixed another bug with argv handling for afl-fuzz in -Q mode. Reported
    by Jonathan Neuschafer.

  - Improved the use of colors when showing crash counts in -C mode.

--------------
Version 1.46b:
--------------

  - Improved instrumentation performance on 32-bit systems by getting rid of
    xor-swap (oddly enough, xor-swap is still faster on 64-bit) and tweaking
    alignment.

  - Made path depth numbers more accurate with imported test cases.

--------------
Version 1.45b:
--------------

  - Added support for SIMPLE_FILES in config.h for folks who don't like
    descriptive file names. Generates very simple names without colons,
    commas, plus signs, dashes, etc.

  - Replaced zero-sized files with symlinks in the variable behavior state
    dir to simplify examining the relevant test cases.

  - Changed the period of limited-range block ops from 5 to 10 minutes based
    on a couple of experiments. The basic goal of this delay timer behavior
    is to better support jobs that are seeded with completely invalid files,
    in which case, the first few queue cycles may be completed very quickly
    without discovering new paths. Should have no effect on well-seeded jobs.

  - Made several minor updates to docs.

--------------
Version 1.44b:
--------------

  - Corrected two bungled attempts to get the -C mode work properly
    with afl-cmin (accounting for the short-lived releases tagged 1.42 and
    1.43b) - sorry.

  - Removed AFL_ALLOW_CRASHES in favor of the -C mode in said tool.

  - Said goodbye to Hello Kitty, as requested by Padraig Brady.

--------------
Version 1.41b:
--------------

  - Added AFL_ALLOW_CRASHES=1 to afl-cmin. Allows crashing inputs in the
    output corpus. Changed the default behavior to disallow it.

  - Made the afl-cmin output dir default to 0700, not 0755, to be consistent
    with afl-fuzz; documented the rationale for 0755 in afl-plot.

  - Lowered the output dir reuse time limit to 25 minutes as a dice-roll
    compromise after a discussion on afl-users@.

  - Made afl-showmap accept -o /dev/null without borking out.

  - Added support for crash / hang info in exit codes of afl-showmap.

  - Tweaked block operation scaling to also factor in ballpark run time
    in cases where queue passes take very little time.

  - Fixed typos and made improvements to several docs.

--------------
Version 1.40b:
--------------

  - Switched to smaller block op sizes during the first passes over the
    queue. Helps keep test cases small.

  - Added memory barrier for run_target(), just in case compilers get
    smarter than they are today.

  - Updated a bunch of docs.

--------------
Version 1.39b:
--------------

  - Added the ability to skip inputs by sending SIGUSR1 to the fuzzer.

  - Reworked several portions of the documentation.

  - Changed the code to reset splicing perf scores between runs to keep
    them closer to intended length.

  - Reduced the minimum value of -t to 5 for afl-fuzz (~200 exec/sec)
    and to 10 for auxiliary tools (due to the absence of a fork server).

  - Switched to more aggressive default timeouts (rounded up to 25 ms
    versus 50 ms - ~40 execs/sec) and made several other cosmetic changes
    to the timeout code.

--------------
Version 1.38b:
--------------

  - Fixed a bug in the QEMU build script, spotted by William Robinet.

  - Improved the reporting of skipped bitflips to keep the UI counters a bit
    more accurate.

  - Cleaned up related_work.txt and added some non-goals.

  - Fixed typos, thanks to Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 1.37b:
--------------

  - Added effector maps, which detect regions that do not seem to respond
    to bitflips and subsequently exclude them from more expensive steps
    (arithmetics, known ints, etc). This should offer significant performance
    improvements with quite a few types of text-based formats, reducing the
    number of deterministic execs by a factor of 2 or so.

  - Cleaned up mem limit handling in afl-cmin.

  - Switched from uname -i to uname -m to work around Gentoo-specific
    issues with coreutils when building QEMU. Reported by William Robinet.

  - Switched from PID checking to flock() to detect running sessions.
    Problem, against all odds, bumped into by Jakub Wilk.

  - Added SKIP_COUNTS and changed the behavior of COVERAGE_ONLY in config.h.
    Useful only for internal benchmarking.

  - Made improvements to UI refresh rates and exec/sec stats to make them
    more stable.

  - Made assorted improvements to the documentation and to the QEMU build
    script.

  - Switched from perror() to strerror() in error macros, thanks to Jakub
    Wilk for the nag.

  - Moved afl-cmin back to bash, wasn't thinking straight. It has to stay
    on bash because other shells may have restrictive limits on array sizes.

--------------
Version 1.36b:
--------------

  - Switched afl-cmin over to /bin/sh. Thanks to Jonathan Gray.

  - Fixed an off-by-one bug in queue limit check when resuming sessions
    (could cause NULL ptr deref if you are *really* unlucky).

  - Fixed the QEMU script to tolerate i686 if returned by uname -i. Based on
    a problem report from Sebastien Duquette.

  - Added multiple references to Jakub's ppvm tool.

  - Made several minor improvements to the Makefile.

  - Believe it or not, fixed some typos. Thanks to Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 1.35b:
--------------

  - Cleaned up regular expressions in some of the scripts to avoid errors
    on *BSD systems. Spotted by Jonathan Gray.

--------------
Version 1.34b:
--------------

  - Performed a substantial documentation and program output cleanup to
    better explain the QEMU feature.

--------------
Version 1.33b:
--------------

  - Added support for AFL_INST_RATIO and AFL_INST_LIBS in the QEMU mode.

  - Fixed a stack allocation crash in QEMU mode (bug in QEMU, fixed with
    an extra patch applied to the downloaded release).

  - Added code to test the QEMU instrumentation once the afl-qemu-trace
    binary is built.

  - Modified afl-tmin and afl-showmap to search $PATH for binaries and to
    better handle QEMU support.

  - Added a check for instrumented binaries when passing -Q to afl-fuzz.

--------------
Version 1.32b:
--------------

  - Fixed 'make install' following the QEMU changes. Spotted by Hanno Boeck.

  - Fixed EXTRA_PAR handling in afl-cmin.

--------------
Version 1.31b:
--------------

  - Hallelujah! Thanks to Andrew Griffiths, we now support very fast, black-box
    instrumentation of binary-only code. See qemu_mode/README.qemu.

    To use this feature, you need to follow the instructions in that
    directory and then run afl-fuzz with -Q.

--------------
Version 1.30b:
--------------

  - Added -s (summary) option to afl-whatsup. Suggested by Jodie Cunningham.

  - Added a sanity check in afl-tmin to detect minimization to zero len or
    excess hangs.

  - Fixed alphabet size counter in afl-tmin.

  - Slightly improved the handling of -B in afl-fuzz.

  - Fixed process crash messages with -m none.

--------------
Version 1.29b:
--------------

  - Improved the naming of test cases when orig: is already present in the file
    name.

  - Made substantial improvements to technical_details.txt.

--------------
Version 1.28b:
--------------

  - Made a minor tweak to the instrumentation to preserve the directionality
    of tuples (i.e., A -> B != B -> A) and to maintain the identity of tight
    loops (A -> A). You need to recompile targeted binaries to leverage this.

  - Cleaned up some of the afl-whatsup stats.

  - Added several sanity checks to afl-cmin.

--------------
Version 1.27b:
--------------

  - Made afl-tmin recursive. Thanks to Hanno Boeck for the tip.

  - Added docs/technical_details.txt.

  - Changed afl-showmap search strategy in afl-cmap to just look into the
    same place that afl-cmin is executed from. Thanks to Jakub Wilk.

  - Removed current_todo.txt and cleaned up the remaining docs.

--------------
Version 1.26b:
--------------

  - Added total execs/sec stat for afl-whatsup.

  - afl-cmin now auto-selects between cp or ln. Based on feedback from
    Even Huus.

  - Fixed a typo. Thanks to Jakub Wilk.

  - Made afl-gotcpu a bit more accurate by using getrusage instead of
    times. Thanks to Jakub Wilk.

  - Fixed a memory limit issue during the build process on NetBSD-current.
    Reported by Thomas Klausner.

--------------
Version 1.25b:
--------------

  - Introduced afl-whatsup, a simple tool for querying the status of
    local synced instances of afl-fuzz.

  - Added -x compiler to clang options on Darwin. Suggested by Filipe
    Cabecinhas.

  - Improved exit codes for afl-gotcpu.

  - Improved the checks for -m and -t values in afl-cmin. Bug report
    from Evan Huus.

--------------
Version 1.24b:
--------------

  - Introduced afl-getcpu, an experimental tool to empirically measure
    CPU preemption rates. Thanks to Jakub Wilk for the idea.

--------------
Version 1.23b:
--------------

  - Reverted one change to afl-cmin that actually made it slower.

--------------
Version 1.22b:
--------------

  - Reworked afl-showmap.c to support normal options, including -o, -q,
    -e. Also added support for timeouts and memory limits.

  - Made changes to afl-cmin and other scripts to accommodate the new
    semantics.

  - Officially retired AFL_EDGES_ONLY.

  - Fixed another typo in afl-tmin, courtesy of Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 1.21b:
--------------

  - Graduated minimize_corpus.sh to afl-cmin. It is now a first-class
    utility bundled with the fuzzer. 

  - Made significant improvements to afl-cmin to make it faster, more
    robust, and more versatile.

  - Refactored some of afl-tmin code to make it a bit more readable.

  - Made assorted changes to the doc to document afl-cmin and other stuff.

--------------
Version 1.20b:
--------------

  - Added AFL_DUMB_FORKSRV, as requested by Jakub Wilk. This works only
    in -n mode and allows afl-fuzz to run with "dummy" fork servers that
    don't output any instrumentation, but follow the same protocol.

  - Renamed AFL_SKIP_CHECKS to AFL_SKIP_BIN_CHECK to make it at least
    somewhat descriptive.

  - Switched to using clang as the default assembler on MacOS X to work
    around Xcode issues with newer builds of clang. Testing and patch by
    Nico Weber.

  - Fixed a typo (via Jakub Wilk).

--------------
Version 1.19b:
--------------

  - Improved exec failure detection in afl-fuzz and afl-showmap.

  - Improved Ctrl-C handling in afl-showmap.

  - Added afl-tmin, a handy instrumentation-enabled minimizer.

--------------
Version 1.18b:
--------------

  - Fixed a serious but short-lived bug in the resumption behavior introduced
    in version 1.16b.

  - Added -t nn+ mode for soft-skipping timing-out paths.

--------------
Version 1.17b:
--------------

  - Fixed a compiler warning introduced in 1.16b for newer versions of GCC.
    Thanks to Jakub Wilk and Ilfak Guilfanov.

  - Improved the consistency of saving fuzzer_stats, bitmap info, and
    auto-dictionaries when aborting fuzzing sessions.

  - Made several noticeable performance improvements to deterministic arith
    and known int steps.

--------------
Version 1.16b:
--------------

  - Added a bit of code to make resumption pick up from the last known
    offset in the queue, rather than always rewinding to the start. Suggested
    by Jakub Wilk.

  - Switched to tighter timeout control for slow programs (3x rather than
    5x average exec speed at init).

--------------
Version 1.15b:
--------------

  - Added support for AFL_NO_VAR_CHECK to speed up resumption and inhibit
    variable path warnings for some programs.

  - Made the trimmer run even for variable paths, since there is no special
    harm in doing so and it can be very beneficial if the trimming still
    pans out.

  - Made the UI a bit more descriptive by adding "n/a" instead of "0" in a
    couple of corner cases.

--------------
Version 1.14b:
--------------

  - Added a (partial) dictionary for JavaScript.

  - Added AFL_NO_CPU_RED, as suggested by Jakub Wilk.

  - Tweaked the havoc scaling logic added in 1.12b.

--------------
Version 1.13b:
--------------

  - Improved the performance of minimize_corpus.sh by switching to a
    sort-based approach.

  - Made several minor revisions to the docs.

--------------
Version 1.12b:
--------------

  - Made an improvement to dictionary generation to avoid runs of identical
    bytes.

  - Added havoc cycle scaling to help with slow binaries in -d mode. Based on
    a thread with Sami Liedes.

  - Added AFL_SYNC_FIRST for afl-fuzz. This is useful for those who obsess
    over stats, no special purpose otherwise.

  - Switched to more robust box drawing codes, suggested by Jakub Wilk.

  - Created faster 64-bit variants of several critical-path bitmap functions
    (sorry, no difference on 32 bits).

  - Fixed moar typos, as reported by Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 1.11b:
--------------

  - Added a bit more info about dictionary strategies to the status screen.

--------------
Version 1.10b:
--------------

  - Revised the dictionary behavior to use insertion and overwrite in
    deterministic steps, rather than just the latter. This improves coverage
    with SQL and the like.

  - Added a mention of "*" in status_screen.txt, as suggested by Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 1.09b:
--------------

  - Corrected a cosmetic problem with 'extras' stage count not always being
    accurate in the stage yields view.

  - Fixed a typo reported by Jakub Wilk and made some minor documentation
    improvements.

--------------
Version 1.08b:
--------------

  - Fixed a div-by-zero bug in the newly-added code when using a dictionary.

--------------
Version 1.07b:
--------------

  - Added code that automatically finds and extracts syntax tokens from the
    input corpus.

  - Fixed a problem with ld dead-code removal option on MacOS X, reported
    by Filipe Cabecinhas.

  - Corrected minor typos spotted by Jakub Wilk.

  - Added a couple of more exotic archive format samples.

--------------
Version 1.06b:
--------------

  - Switched to slightly more accurate (if still not very helpful) reporting
    of short read and short write errors. These theoretically shouldn't happen
    unless you kill the forkserver or run out of disk space. Suggested by
    Jakub Wilk.

  - Revamped some of the allocator and debug code, adding comments and
    cleaning up other mess.

  - Tweaked the odds of fuzzing non-favored test cases to make sure that
    baseline coverage of all inputs is reached sooner.

--------------
Version 1.05b:
--------------

  - Added a dictionary for WebP.

  - Made some additional performance improvements to minimize_corpus.sh,
    getting deeper into the bash woods.

--------------
Version 1.04b:
--------------

  - Made substantial performance improvements to minimize_corpus.sh with
    large datasets, albeit at the expense of having to switch back to bash
    (other shells may have limits on array sizes, etc).

  - Tweaked afl-showmap to support the format used by the new script.

--------------
Version 1.03b:
--------------

  - Added code to skip README.txt in the input directory to make the crash
    exploration mode work better. Suggested by Jakub Wilk.

  - Added a dictionary for SQLite.

--------------
Version 1.02b:
--------------

  - Reverted the ./ search path in minimize_corpus.sh because people did
    not like it.

  - Added very explicit warnings not to run various shell scripts that
    read or write to /tmp/ (since this is generally a pretty bad idea on
    multi-user systems).

  - Added a check for /tmp binaries and -f locations in afl-fuzz.

--------------
Version 1.01b:
--------------

  - Added dictionaries for XML and GIF.

--------------
Version 1.00b:
--------------

  - Slightly improved the performance of minimize_corpus.sh, especially on
    Linux.

  - Made a couple of improvements to calibration timeouts for resumed scans.

--------------
Version 0.99b:
--------------

  - Fixed minimize_corpus.sh to work with dash, as suggested by Jakub Wilk.

  - Modified minimize_corpus.sh to try locate afl-showmap in $PATH and ./.
    The first part requested by Jakub Wilk.

  - Added support for afl-as --version, as required by one funky build
    script. Reported by William Robinet.

--------------
Version 0.98b:
--------------

  - Added a dictionary for TIFF.

  - Fixed another cosmetic snafu with stage exec counts for -x.

  - Switched afl-plot to /bin/sh, since it seems bashism-free. Also tried
    to remove any obvious bashisms from other experimental/ scripts,
    most notably including minimize_corpus.sh and triage_crashes.sh.
    Requested by Jonathan Gray.

--------------
Version 0.97b:
--------------

  - Fixed cosmetic issues around the naming of -x strategy files.

  - Added a dictionary for JPEG.

  - Fixed a very rare glitch when running instrumenting 64-bit code that makes
    heavy use of xmm registers that are also touched by glibc.

--------------
Version 0.96b:
--------------

  - Added support for extra dictionaries, provided testcases/_extras/png/
    as a demo.

  - Fixed a minor bug in number formatting routines used by the UI.

  - Added several additional PNG test cases that are relatively unlikely
    to be hit by chance.

  - Fixed afl-plot syntax for gnuplot 5.x. Reported by David Necas.

--------------
Version 0.95b:
--------------

  - Cleaned up the OSX ReportCrash code. Thanks to Tobias Ospelt for help.

  - Added some extra tips for AFL_NO_FORKSERVER on OSX.

  - Refreshed the INSTALL file.

--------------
Version 0.94b:
--------------

  - Added in-place resume (-i-) to address a common user complaint.

  - Added an awful workaround for ReportCrash on MacOS X. Problem
    spotted by Joseph Gentle.

--------------
Version 0.93b:
--------------

  - Fixed the link() workaround, as reported by Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 0.92b:
--------------

  - Added support for reading test cases from another filesystem.
    Requested by Jakub Wilk.

  - Added pointers to the mailing list.

  - Added a sample PDF document.

--------------
Version 0.91b:
--------------

  - Refactored minimize_corpus.sh to make it a bit more user-friendly and to
    select for smallest files, not largest bitmaps. Offers a modest corpus
    size improvement in most cases.

  - Slightly improved the performance of splicing code.

--------------
Version 0.90b:
--------------

  - Moved to an algorithm where paths are marked as preferred primarily based
    on size and speed, rather than bitmap coverage. This should offer
    noticeable performance gains in many use cases.

  - Refactored path calibration code; calibration now takes place as soon as a
    test case is discovered, to facilitate better prioritization decisions later
    on.

  - Changed the way of marking variable paths to avoid .state metadata
    inconsistencies.

  - Made sure that calibration routines always create a new test case to avoid
    hypothetical problems with utilities that modify the input file.

  - Added bitmap saturation to fuzzer stats and plot data.

  - Added a testcase for JPEG XR.

  - Added a tty check for the colors warning in Makefile, to keep distro build
    logs tidy. Suggested by Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 0.89b:
--------------

  - Renamed afl-plot.sh to afl-plot, as requested by Padraig Brady.

  - Improved the compatibility of afl-plot with older versions of gnuplot.

  - Added banner information to fuzzer_stats, populated it to afl-plot.

--------------
Version 0.88b:
--------------

  - Added support for plotting, with design and implementation based on a
    prototype design proposed by by Michael Rash. Huge thanks!

  - Added afl-plot.sh, which allows you to, well, generate a nice plot using
    this data.

  - Refactored the code slightly to make more frequent updates to fuzzer_stats
    and to provide more detail about synchronization.

  - Added a fflush(stdout) call for non-tty operation, as requested by 
    Joonas Kuorilehto.

  - Added some detail to fuzzer_stats for parity with plot_file.

--------------
Version 0.87b:
--------------

  - Added support for MSAN, via AFL_USE_MSAN, same gotchas as for ASAN.

--------------
Version 0.86b:
--------------

  - Added AFL_NO_FORKSRV, allowing the forkserver to be bypassed. Suggested
    by Ryan Govostes.

  - Simplified afl-showmap.c to make use of the no-forkserver mode.

  - Made minor improvements to crash_triage.sh, as suggested by Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 0.85b:
--------------

  - Fixed the CPU counting code - no sysctlbyname() on OpenBSD, d'oh. Bug
    reported by Daniel Dickman.

  - Made a slight correction to error messages - the advice on testing
    with ulimit was a tiny bit off by a factor of 1024.

--------------
Version 0.84b:
--------------

  - Added support for the CPU widget on some non-Linux platforms (I hope).
    Based on feedback from Ryan Govostes.

  - Cleaned up the changelog (very meta).

--------------
Version 0.83b:
--------------

  - Added experimental/clang_asm_normalize/ and related notes in 
    env_variables.txt and afl-as.c. Thanks to Ryan Govostes for the idea.

  - Added advice on hardware utilization in README.

--------------
Version 0.82b:
--------------

  - Made additional fixes for Xcode support, juggling -Q and -q flags. Thanks to
    Ryan Govostes.

  - Added a check for __asm__ blocks and switches to .intel_syntax in assembly.
    Based on feedback from Ryan Govostes.

--------------
Version 0.81b:
--------------

  - A workaround for Xcode 6 as -Q flag glitch. Spotted by Ryan Govostes.

  - Improved Solaris build instructions, as suggested by Martin Carpenter.

  - Fix for a slightly busted path scoring conditional. Minor practical impact.

--------------
Version 0.80b:
--------------

  - Added a check for $PATH-induced loops. Problem noticed by Kartik Agaram.

  - Added AFL_KEEP_ASSEMBLY for easier troubleshooting.

  - Added an override for AFL_USE_ASAN if set at afl compile time. Requested by
    Hanno Boeck.

--------------
Version 0.79b:
--------------

  - Made minor adjustments to path skipping logic.

  - Made several documentation updates to reflect the path selection changes
    made in 0.78b.

--------------
Version 0.78b:
--------------

  - Added a CPU governor check. Bug report from Joe Zbiciak.

  - Favored paths are now selected strictly based on new edges, not hit
    counts. This speeds up the first pass by a factor of 3-6x without
    significantly impacting ultimate coverage (tested with libgif, libpng,
    libjpeg).

    It also allows some performance & memory usage improvements by making
    some of the in-memory bitmaps much smaller.

  - Made multiple significant performance improvements to bitmap checking
    functions, plus switched to a faster hash.

  - Owing largely to these optimizations, bumped the size of the bitmap to
    64k and added a warning to detect older binaries that rely on smaller
    bitmaps.

--------------
Version 0.77b:
--------------

  - Added AFL_SKIP_CHECKS to bypass binary checks when really warranted.
    Feature requested by Jakub Wilk.

  - Fixed a couple of typos.

  - Added a warning for runs that are aborted early on.

--------------
Version 0.76b:
--------------

  - Incorporated another signal handling fix for Solaris. Suggestion
    submitted by Martin Carpenter.

--------------
Version 0.75b:
--------------

  - Implemented a slightly more "elegant" kludge for the %llu glitch (see
    types.h).

  - Relaxed CPU load warnings to stay in sync with reality.

--------------
Version 0.74b:
--------------

  - Switched to more responsive exec speed averages and better UI speed
    scaling.

  - Fixed a bug with interrupted reads on Solaris. Issue spotted by Martin
    Carpenter.

--------------
Version 0.73b:
--------------

  - Fixed a stray memcpy() instead of memmove() on overlapping buffers.
    Mostly harmless but still dumb. Mistake spotted thanks to David Higgs.

--------------
Version 0.72b:
--------------

  - Bumped map size up to 32k. You may want to recompile instrumented
    binaries (but nothing horrible will happen if you don't).

  - Made huge performance improvements for bit-counting functions.

  - Default optimizations now include -funroll-loops. This should have
    interesting effects on the instrumentation. Frankly, I'm just going to
    ship it and see what happens next. I have a good feeling about this.

  - Made a fix for stack alignment crash on MacOS X 10.10; looks like the 
    rhetorical question in the comments in afl-as.h has been answered.
    Tracked down by Mudge Zatko.

--------------
Version 0.71b:
--------------

  - Added a fix for the nonsensical MacOS ELF check. Spotted by Mudge Zatko.

  - Made some improvements to ASAN checks.

--------------
Version 0.70b:
--------------

  - Added explicit detection of ASANified binaries.

  - Fixed compilation issues on Solaris. Reported by Martin Carpenter.

--------------
Version 0.69b:
--------------

  - Improved the detection of non-instrumented binaries.

  - Made the crash counter in -C mode accurate.

  - Fixed an obscure install bug that made afl-as non-functional with the tool
    installed to /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin. Found by Florian Kiersch.

  - Fixed for a cosmetic SIGFPE when Ctrl-C is pressed while the fork server
    is spinning up.

--------------
Version 0.68b:
--------------

  - Added crash exploration mode! Woot!

--------------
Version 0.67b:
--------------

  - Fixed several more typos, the project is now cartified 100% typo-free.
    Thanks to Thomas Jarosch and Jakub Wilk.

  - Made a change to write fuzzer_stats early on.

  - Fixed a glitch when (not!) running on MacOS X as root. Spotted by Tobias
    Ospelt.

  - Made it possible to override -O3 in Makefile. Suggested by Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 0.66b:
--------------

  - Fixed a very obscure issue with build systems that use gcc as an assembler
    for hand-written .s files; this would confuse afl-as. Affected nss, reported
    by Hanno Boeck.

  - Fixed a bug when cleaning up synchronized fuzzer output dirs. Issue reported
    by Thomas Jarosch.

--------------
Version 0.65b:
--------------

  - Cleaned up shell printf escape codes in Makefile. Reported by Jakub Wilk.

  - Added more color to fuzzer_stats, provided short documentation of the file
    format, and made several other stats-related improvements.

--------------
Version 0.64b:
--------------

  - Enabled GCC support on MacOS X.

--------------
Version 0.63b:
--------------

  - Provided a new, simplified way to pass data in files (@@). See README.

  - Made additional fixes for 64-bit MacOS X, working around a crashing bug in
    their linker (umpf) and several other things. It's alive!

  - Added a minor workaround for a bug in 64-bit FreeBSD (clang -m32 -g doesn't
    work on that platform, but clang -m32 does, so we no longer insert -g).

  - Added a build-time warning for inverse video terminals and better
    instructions in status_screen.txt.

--------------
Version 0.62b:
--------------

  - Made minor improvements to the allocator, as suggested by Tobias Ospelt.

  - Added example instrumented memcmp() in experimental/instrumented_cmp.

  - Added a speculative fix for MacOS X (clang detection, again).

  - Fixed typos in parallel_fuzzing.txt. Problems spotted by Thomas Jarosch.

--------------
Version 0.61b:
--------------

  - Fixed a minor issue with clang detection on systems with a clang cc
    wrapper, so that afl-gcc doesn't confuse it with GCC.

  - Made cosmetic improvements to docs and to the CPU load indicator.

  - Fixed a glitch with crash removal (README.txt left behind, d'oh).

--------------
Version 0.60b:
--------------

  - Fixed problems with jump tables generated by exotic versions of GCC. This
    solves an outstanding problem on OpenBSD when using afl-gcc + PIE (not
    present with afl-clang).

  - Fixed permissions on one of the sample archives.

  - Added a lahf / sahf workaround for OpenBSD (their assembler doesn't know
    about these opcodes).

  - Added docs/INSTALL.

--------------
Version 0.59b:
--------------

  - Modified 'make install' to also install test cases.

  - Provided better pointers to installed README in afl-fuzz.

  - More work on RLIMIT_AS for OpenBSD.

--------------
Version 0.58b:
--------------

  - Added a core count check on Linux.

  - Refined the code for the lack-of-RLIMIT_AS case on OpenBSD.

  - Added a rudimentary CPU utilization meter to help with optimal loading.

--------------
Version 0.57b:
--------------

  - Made fixes to support FreeBSD and OpenBSD: use_64bit is now inferred if not
    explicitly specified when calling afl-as, and RLIMIT_AS is behind an #ifdef.
    Thanks to Fabian Keil and Jonathan Gray for helping troubleshoot this.

  - Modified 'make install' to also install docs (in /usr/local/share/doc/afl).

  - Fixed a typo in status_screen.txt.

  - Made a couple of Makefile improvements as proposed by Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 0.56b:
--------------

  - Added probabilistic instrumentation density reduction in ASAN mode. This
    compensates for ASAN-specific branches in a crude but workable way.

  - Updated notes_for_asan.txt.

--------------
Version 0.55b:
--------------

  - Implemented smarter out_dir behavior, automatically deleting directories
    that don't contain anything of special value. Requested by several folks,
    including Hanno Boeck.

  - Added more detail in fuzzer_stats (start time, run time, fuzzer PID).

  - Implemented support for configurable install prefixes in Makefile
    ($PREFIX), as requested by Luca Barbato.

  - Made it possible to resume by doing -i <out_dir>, without having to specify
    -i <out_dir>/queue/.

--------------
Version 0.54b:
--------------

  - Added a fix for -Wformat warning messages (oops, I thought this had been in
    place for a while).

--------------
Version 0.53b:
--------------

  - Redesigned the crash & hang duplicate detection code to better deal with
    fault conditions that can be reached in a multitude of ways.

    The old approach could be compared to hashing stack traces to de-dupe
    crashes, a method prone to crash count inflation. The alternative I
    wanted to avoid would be equivalent to just looking at crash %eip,
    which can have false negatives in common functions such as memcpy().

    The middle ground currently used in afl-fuzz can be compared to looking
    at every line item in the stack trace and tagging crashes as unique if
    we see any function name that we haven't seen before (or if something that
    we have *always* seen there suddenly disappears). We do the comparison
    without paying any attention to ordering or hit counts. This can still
    cause some crash inflation early on, but the problem will quickly taper
    off. So, you may get 20 dupes instead of 5,000.
    
  - Added a fix for harmless but absurd trim ratios shown if the first exec in
    the trimmer timed out. Spotted by @EspenGx.

--------------
Version 0.52b:
--------------

  - Added a quick summary of the contents in experimental/.

  - Made a fix to the process of writing fuzzer_stats.

  - Slightly reorganized the .state/ directory, now recording redundant paths,
    too. Note that this breaks the ability to properly resume older sessions 
    - sorry about that.

    (To fix this, simply move <out_dir>/.state/* from an older run
    to <out_dir>/.state/deterministic_done/*.)

--------------
Version 0.51b:
--------------

  - Changed the search order for afl-as to avoid the problem with older copies
    installed system-wide; this also means that I can remove the Makefile check
    for that.

  - Made it possible to set instrumentation ratio of 0%.

  - Introduced some typos, fixed others.

  - Fixed the test_prev target in Makefile, as reported by Ozzy Johnson.

--------------
Version 0.50b:
--------------

  - Improved the 'make install' logic, as suggested by Padraig Brady.

  - Revamped various bits of the documentation, especially around perf_tips.txt;
    based on the feedback from Alexander Cherepanov.

  - Added AFL_INST_RATIO to afl-as. The only case where this comes handy is
    ffmpeg, at least as far as I can tell. (Trivia: the current version of 
    ffmpeg ./configure also ignores CC and --cc, probably unintentionally).

  - Added documentation for all environmental variables (env_variables.txt).

  - Implemented a visual warning for excessive or insufficient bitmap density.

  - Changed afl-gcc to add -O3 by default; use AFL_DONT_OPTIMIZE if you don't
    like that. Big speed gain for ffmpeg, so seems like a good idea.

  - Made a regression fix to afl-as to ignore .LBB labels in gcc mode.

--------------
Version 0.49b:
--------------

  - Fixed more typos, as found by Jakub Wilk.

  - Added support for clang!

  - Changed AFL_HARDEN to *not* include ASAN by default. Use AFL_USE_ASAN if
    needed. The reasons for this are in notes_for_asan.txt.

  - Switched from configure auto-detection to isatty() to keep afl-as and
    afl-gcc quiet.

  - Improved installation process to properly create symlinks, rather than
    copies of binaries.

--------------
Version 0.48b:
--------------

  - Improved afl-fuzz to force-set ASAN_OPTIONS=abort_on_error=1. Otherwise,
    ASAN crashes wouldn't be caught at all. Reported by Hanno Boeck.

  - Improved Makefile mkdir logic, as suggested by Hanno Boeck.

  - Improved the 64-bit instrumentation to properly save r8-r11 registers in
    the x86 setup code. The old behavior could cause rare problems running
    *without* instrumentation when the first function called in a particular
    .o file has 5+ parameters. No impact on code running under afl-fuzz or
    afl-showmap. Issue spotted by Padraig Brady.

--------------
Version 0.47b:
--------------

  - Fixed another Makefile bug for parallel builds of afl. Problem identified
    by Richard W. M. Jones.

  - Added support for suffixes for -m.

  - Updated the documentation and added notes_for_asan.txt. Based on feedback
    from Hanno Boeck, Ben Laurie, and others.

  - Moved the project to http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/.

--------------
Version 0.46b:
--------------

  - Cleaned up Makefile dependencies for parallel builds. Requested by 
    Richard W. M. Jones.

  - Added support for DESTDIR in Makefile. Once again suggested by
    Richard W. M. Jones :-)

  - Removed all the USE_64BIT stuff; we now just auto-detect compilation mode.
    As requested by many callers to the show.

  - Fixed rare problems with programs that use snippets of assembly and
    switch between .code32 and .code64. Addresses a glitch spotted by
    Hanno Boeck with compiling ToT gdb.

--------------
Version 0.45b:
--------------

  - Implemented a test case trimmer. Results in 20-30% size reduction for many
    types of work loads, with very pronounced improvements in path discovery
    speeds.

  - Added better warnings for various problems with input directories.

  - Added a Makefile warning for older copies, based on counterintuitive
    behavior observed by Hovik Manucharyan.

  - Added fuzzer_stats file for status monitoring. Suggested by @dronesec.

  - Fixed moar typos, thanks to Alexander Cherepanov.

  - Implemented better warnings for ASAN memory requirements, based on calls
    from several angry listeners.

  - Switched to saner behavior with non-tty stdout (less output generated,
    no ANSI art).

--------------
Version 0.44b:
--------------

  - Added support for AFL_CC and AFL_CXX, based on a patch from Ben Laurie.

  - Replaced afl-fuzz -S -D with -M for simplicity.

  - Added a check for .section .text; lack of this prevented main() from
    getting instrumented for some users. Reported by Tom Ritter.

  - Reorganized the testcases/ directory.

  - Added an extra check to confirm that the build is operational.

  - Made more consistent use of color reset codes, as suggested by Oliver
    Kunz.

--------------
Version 0.43b:
--------------

  - Fixed a bug with 64-bit gcc -shared relocs.

  - Removed echo -e from Makefile for compatibility with dash. Suggested
    by Jakub Wilk.

  - Added status_screen.txt.

  - Added experimental/canvas_harness.

  - Made a minor change to the Makefile GCC check. Suggested by Hanno Boeck.

--------------
Version 0.42b:
--------------

  - Fixed a bug with red zone handling for 64-bit (oops!). Problem reported by
    Felix Groebert.

  - Implemented horribly experimental ARM support in experimental/arm_support.

  - Made several improvements to error messages.

  - Added AFL_QUIET to silence afl-gcc and afl-as when using wonky build
    systems. Reported by Hanno Boeck.

  - Improved check for 64-bit compilation, plus several sanity checks
    in Makefile.

--------------
Version 0.41b:
--------------

  - Fixed a fork served bug for processes that call execve().

  - Made minor compatibility fixes to Makefile, afl-gcc; suggested by Jakub
    Wilk.

  - Fixed triage_crashes.sh to work with the new layout of output directories.
    Suggested by Jakub Wilk.

  - Made multiple performance-related improvements to the injected
    instrumentation.

  - Added visual indication of the number of imported paths.

  - Fixed afl-showmap to make it work well with new instrumentation.

  - Added much better error messages for crashes when importing test cases
    or otherwise calibrating the binary.

--------------
Version 0.40b:
--------------

  - Added support for parallelized fuzzing. Inspired by earlier patch
    from Sebastian Roschke.

  - Added an example in experimental/distributed_fuzzing/.

--------------
Version 0.39b:
--------------

  - Redesigned status screen, now 90% more spiffy.

  - Added more verbose and user-friendly messages for some common problems.

  - Modified the resumption code to reconstruct path depth.

  - Changed the code to inhibit core dumps and improve the ability to detect
    SEGVs.

  - Added a check for redirection of core dumps to programs.

  - Made a minor improvement to the handling of variable paths.

  - Made additional performance tweaks to afl-fuzz, chiefly around mem limits.

  - Added performance_tips.txt.

--------------
Version 0.38b:
--------------

  - Fixed an fd leak and +cov tracking bug resulting from changes in 0.37b.

  - Implemented auto-scaling for screen update speed.

  - Added a visual indication when running in non-instrumented mode.

--------------
Version 0.37b:
--------------

  - Added fuzz state tracking for more seamless resumption of aborted
    fuzzing sessions.

  - Removed the -D option, as it's no longer necessary.

  - Refactored calibration code and improved startup reporting.

  - Implemented dynamically scaled timeouts, so that you don't need to
    play with -t except in some very rare cases.

  - Added visual notification for slow binaries.

  - Improved instrumentation to explicitly cover the other leg of every
    branch.

--------------
Version 0.36b:
--------------

  - Implemented fork server support to avoid the overhead of execve(). A
    nearly-verbatim design from Jann Horn; still pending part 2 that would
    also skip initial setup steps (thinking about reliable heuristics now).

  - Added a check for shell scripts used as fuzz targets.

  - Added a check for fuzz jobs that don't seem to be finding anything.

  - Fixed the way IGNORE_FINDS works (was a bit broken after adding splicing
    and path skip heuristics).

--------------
Version 0.35b:
--------------

  - Properly integrated 64-bit instrumentation into afl-as.

--------------
Version 0.34b:
--------------

  - Added a new exec count classifier (the working theory is that it gets
    meaningful coverage with fewer test cases spewed out).

--------------
Version 0.33b:
--------------

  - Switched to new, somewhat experimental instrumentation that tries to
    target only arcs, rather than every line. May be fragile, but is a lot
    faster (2x+).

  - Made several other cosmetic fixes and typo corrections, thanks to
    Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 0.32b:
--------------

  - Another take at fixing the C++ exception thing. Reported by Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 0.31b:
--------------

  - Made another fix to afl-as to address a potential problem with newer
    versions of GCC (introduced in 0.28b). Thanks to Jann Horn.

--------------
Version 0.30b:
--------------

  - Added more detail about the underlying operations in file names.

--------------
Version 0.29b:
--------------

  - Made some general improvements to chunk operations.

--------------
Version 0.28b:
--------------

  - Fixed C++ exception handling in newer versions of GCC. Problem diagnosed
    by Eberhard Mattes.

  - Fixed the handling of the overflow flag. Once again, thanks to
    Eberhard Mattes.

--------------
Version 0.27b:
--------------

  - Added prioritization of new paths over the already-fuzzed ones.

  - Included spliced test case ID in the output file name.

  - Fixed a rare, cosmetic null ptr deref after Ctrl-C.

  - Refactored the code to make copies of test cases in the output directory.

  - Switched to better output file names, keeping track of stage and splicing
    sources.

--------------
Version 0.26b:
--------------

  - Revamped storage of testcases, -u option removed,

  - Added a built-in effort minimizer to get rid of potentially redundant
    inputs,

  - Provided a testcase count minimization script in experimental/,

  - Made miscellaneous improvements to directory and file handling.

--------------
Version 0.21b:
--------------

  - Initial public release.
